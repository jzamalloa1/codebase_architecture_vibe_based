# Codebase Architecture Documentation Generator

This project contains an HTML-based documentation generator that creates high-level architectural diagrams and explanations for code repositories. It was generated by an LLM (Claude) through Cursor IDE to analyze and document the structure of the [chat_model_claude_vibe_based](https://github.com/jzamalloa1/chat_model_claude_vibe_based) repository.

## Purpose

The documentation generator provides:
- Visual system architecture diagrams
- Component breakdowns
- Flow diagrams
- Project structure explanations
- Security considerations
- Deployment options

## Features

- **Interactive HTML Output**: The documentation is presented in a clean, responsive HTML format
- **ASCII Diagrams**: Uses ASCII art for compatibility and easy viewing
- **Component Breakdowns**: Detailed explanations of each major component
- **Flow Diagrams**: Visual representation of user interactions and system processes
- **Security Considerations**: Highlights important security features
- **Deployment Information**: Outlines available deployment options

## Usage

The generated documentation can be viewed by opening the `architecture_diagram.html` file in any web browser. The documentation includes:

1. Project Overview
2. System Architecture
3. Project Structure
4. Key Components
5. Flow Diagrams
6. Security Features
7. Deployment Options

## Generation Process

This documentation was generated based on the following instructions:
> "Here is a code repository: @https://github.com/jzamalloa1/chat_model_claude_vibe_based I want you to try to outline it, explore it and create an HTML file for me that contains high level diagrams explaning how the project works, where is what, so that I have a high level understanding of it."

The LLM analyzed the repository structure and created comprehensive documentation with diagrams to provide a clear understanding of the project's architecture and components.
